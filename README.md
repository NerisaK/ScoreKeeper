# ScoreKeeper

Coding exercice in JavaScript from Colt Steele's course The Web Developer Bootcamp 2021.

The point is to create a simple score keeper that adds score when user clicks on one of the buttons.
The script is also meant to "end the game" (disable buttons and change colors of score numbers)
when one of the players reaches a max score number provided by the user via dropdown menu.

The HTML and CSS was not coded by me this time. I used the code provided by Colt for that. I'm only doing the JavaScript part of the project.
